I was able to implement addition and positive number subtraction of numbers in this program. The integer of infinite length is stored in a doubly linked NULL terminated list, and these several lists (which represent various operands) are stored in a stack. I also use a stack to store the operands, and pop the operands/operators from the respective stack when required.
